This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.\n\nThe recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.\n\n**Note:** If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the `/tmp` directory, this data will still consume space in `/` once the `/tmp` filesystem is mounted unless it is removed first."

If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.\n\nStandard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.\n\n**Note**: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment. For the current available file system modules on the system see `/usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs`\n\n#### Start up scripts\n\nKernel modules loaded directly via `insmod` will ignore what is configured in the relevant `/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` files. If modules are still being loaded after a reboot whilst having the correctly configured `blacklist` and `install` command, check for `insmod` entries in start up scripts such as `.bashrc`.\n\nYou may also want to check `/usr/lib/modprobe.d/`. Please note that this directory should not be used for user defined module loading. Ensure that all such entries resides in `/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` files.\n\n#### Return values\n\nBy using `/bin/false` as the command in disabling a particular module service two purposes; to convey the meaning of the entry to the user and cause a non-zero return value. The latter can be tested for in scripts. Please note that `insmod` will ignore what is configured in the relevant `/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` files. The preferred way to load modules is with `modprobe`."

Since the `/var` directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to `/var` and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See `man auditd.conf` for details.\n\n#### Fine grained control over the mount\nConfiguring `/var` as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as `noexec/nosuid/nodev`. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behaviour. See `man mount` for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.\n\n#### Protection from exploitation\nAn example of exploiting `/var` may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system `setuid` program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."

Since the `/var/tmp` directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to `/var/tmp` and cause the potential disruption to daemons as the disk is full.\n\n#### Fine grained control over the mount\nConfiguring `/var/tmp` as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as `noexec/nosuid/nodev`. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See `man mount` for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.\n\n#### Protection from exploitation\nAn example of exploiting `/var/tmp` may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system `setuid` program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."

Since the `/var/log` directory contain the log files that can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole.\n\n#### Fine grained control over the mount\nConfiguring `/var/log` as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as `noexec/nosuid/nodev`. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See `man mount` for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.\n\n#### Protection of log data\nAs `/var/log` contains log files, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."

Since the `/var/log/audit` directory contain the `audit.log` file that can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to `/var/log/audit` and cause `auditd` to trigger it's `space_left_action` as the disk is full. See `man auditd.conf` for details.\n\n#### Fine grained control over the mount\nConfiguring `/var/log/audit` as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as `noexec/nosuid/nodev`. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See `man mount` for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.\n\n#### Protection of audit data\nAs `/var/log/audit` contains audit logs, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."

Since the `/home` directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to `/home` and impact all local users.\n\n#### Fine grained control over the mount\nConfiguring `/home` as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as `noexec/nosuid/nodev`. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of `/home` options such as `usrquota/grpquota` may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See `man mount` for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.\n\n#### Protection of user data\nAs `/home` contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."

These are the active keys used for verification and installation of RPMs. The packages are fake, they are generated on the fly by `dnf` or `rpm` during the import of keys from the URL specified in the repository configuration.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n# for RPM_PACKAGE in $(rpm -q gpg-pubkey); do\n echo \"RPM: ${RPM_PACKAGE}\"\n RPM_SUMMARY=$(rpm -q --queryformat \"%{SUMMARY}\" \"${RPM_PACKAGE}\")\n RPM_PACKAGER=$(rpm -q --queryformat \"%{PACKAGER}\" \"${RPM_PACKAGE}\")\n RPM_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d -d \"1970-1-1+$((0x$(rpm -q --queryformat \"%{RELEASE}\" \"${RPM_PACKAGE}\") ))sec\")\n RPM_KEY_ID=$(rpm -q --queryformat \"%{VERSION}\" \"${RPM_PACKAGE}\")\n echo \"Packager: ${RPM_PACKAGER}\nSummary: ${RPM_SUMMARY}\nCreation date: ${RPM_DATE}\nKey ID: ${RPM_KEY_ID}\n\"\ndone\n\nRPM: gpg-pubkey-9db62fb1-59920156\nPackager: Fedora 28 (28) <fedora-28@fedoraproject.org>\nSummary: gpg(Fedora 28 (28) <fedora-28@fedoraproject.org>)\nCreation date: 2017-08-14\nKey ID: 9db62fb1\n\nRPM: gpg-pubkey-09eab3f2-595fbba3\nPackager: RPM Fusion free repository for Fedora (28) <rpmfusion-buildsys@lists.rpmfusion.org>\nSummary: gpg(RPM Fusion free repository for Fedora (28) <rpmfusion-buildsys@lists.rpmfusion.org>)\nCreation date: 2017-07-07\nKey ID: 09eab3f2\n```\n\nThe format of the package (`gpg-pubkey-9db62fb1-59920156`) is important to understand for verification. Using the above example, it consists of three parts:\n1. The general prefix name for all imported GPG keys: `gpg-pubkey-`\n2. The version, which is the GPG key ID: `9db62fb1`\n3. The release is the date of the key in UNIX timestamp in hexadecimal: `59920156`\n\nWith both the date and the GPG key ID, check the relevant repositories public key page to confirm that the keys are indeed correct.\n\n#### Query locally available GPG keys\n\nRepositories that store their respective GPG keys on disk should do so in `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/`. These keys are available for immediate import either when `dnf` is asked to install a relevant package from the repository or when an administrator imports the key directly with the `rpm --import` command.\n\nTo find where these keys comes from run:\n\n```\n# for PACKAGE in $(find /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ -type f -exec rpm -qf {} \\; | sort -u); do rpm -q --queryformat \"%{NAME}-%{VERSION} %{PACKAGER} %{SUMMARY}\\\\n\" \"${PACKAGE}\"; done\n```"

                    "prose": "SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts. \n\nThe SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access. \n\nIn Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility. The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services.\n\nThis automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Two such policies have been designed for use with Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions and are included with the system: `targeted` and `mls`. These are described as follows:\n\n- `targeted`: targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker’s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited. SELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial.\n- `mls`: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.\n\nThis section provides guidance for the configuration of the `targeted `policy.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n- Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access.\n- This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist.\n- To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system.\n\nGuidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/\n\nThe `/etc/motd`, `/etc/issue`, and `/etc/issue.net` files govern warning banners for standard command line logins for both local and remote users.\n\n**Note:** The text provided in the remediation actions for these items is intended as an example only. Please edit to include the specific text for your organization as approved by your legal department."

When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through\n\nTo provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for:\n - Netfilter - A set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack. Includes the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules. These modules are some of the significant parts of the Netfilter hook system.\n - nftables - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building blocks of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, and logging subsystem. **Is available in Linux kernels 3.13 and newer**.\n\nIn order to configure firewall rules for Netfilter or nftables, a firewall utility needs to be installed. Guidance has been included for the following firewall utilities:\n - FirewallD - Provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend. Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles. \n - nftables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the Linux kernel\n - iptables - Includes the iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables utilities for configuration Netfilter and the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules.\n\n**Note:**\n- _Only **one** method should be used to configure a firewall on the system. Use of more than one method could produce unexpected results._\n- _This section is intended only to ensure the resulting firewall rules are in place, not how they are configured._"

The biggest change with the successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands. With nftables, the simpler syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and less repetition. Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, together with the related nftables modules. It is available in Linux kernels >= 3.13. **Please ensure that your kernel supports nftables before choosing this option.**\n\nThis section broadly assumes starting with an empty nftables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with nft flush ruleset). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. **Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out**. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot.\n\n_**Note**: Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out.

Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.\nEach chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table. \n\n**Note:**\n- This section broadly assumes starting with an empty ip6tables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with ip6tables -F). \n- Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot. \n\n_The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere. This needs to be updated to only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect as per site policy._\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Flush ip6tables rules\nip6tables -F\n\n# Ensure default deny firewall policy\nip6tables -P INPUT DROP\nip6tables -P OUTPUT DROP\nip6tables -P FORWARD DROP\n\n# Ensure loopback traffic is configured\nip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\nip6tables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT\nip6tables -A INPUT -s ::1 -j DROP\n\n# Ensure outbound and established connections are configured\nip6tables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\nip6tables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\nip6tables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\nip6tables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\nip6tables -A INPUT -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\nip6tables -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\n# Open inbound ssh(tcp port 22) connections\nip6tables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT\n```"

            "prose": "The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.\n\nIt is recommended that `rsyslog `be used for logging (with `logwatch `providing summarization) and `auditd` be used for auditing (with `aureport `providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.\n\nIn addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.\n\nBecause it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference <[http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/](http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/)> manual page for more information on configuring chrony.\n\nIt is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.\n\n**Note on log file permissions:** There really isn't a \"one size fits all\" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as \"wheel\" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (`root:root 600`). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as `root:securegrp 640 `where `securegrp` is the defined security group (in some cases `wheel`)."

                "prose": "The Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default events will be logged to `/var/log/audit/audit.log`, which can be configured in `/etc/audit/auditd.conf`.\n\nThe following types of audit rules can be specified:\n - Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.\n - File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. Also known as file watches.\n - System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.\n\nAudit rules can be set:\n - On the command line using the `auditctl` utility. These rules are not persistent across reboots.\n - In `/etc/audit/audit.rules`. These rules have to be merged and loaded before they are active.\n\n**Notes:**\n - For 64 bit systems that have `arch` as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.\n - If the auditing system is configured to be locked (`-e 2`), a system reboot will be required in order to load any changes.\n - Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used as a compliance auditing. The usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates organisation and searching, as such, all remediation steps will have key names supplied.\n - It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in `/etc/audit/rules.d/`. Rules must end in a `.rules` suffix. This then requires the use of `augenrules` to merge all the rules into `/etc/audit/audit.rules` based on their their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of `50` which is centre weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming convention.\n - Your system may have been customized to change the default `UID_MIN`. All samples output uses `1000`, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing. To confirm the `UID_MIN` for your system, run the following command: `awk '/^\\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs`\n\n#### Normalization\nThe Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep in mind that:\n - With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values `-1` / `unset` / `4294967295` are equivalent and normalized to `-1`.\n - When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields types, such as`euid!=uid`, then the auditing system may normalize such that the output is `uid!=euid`.\n - Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependant on previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:\n\n```\n-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!=-1 -F key=user_emulation\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k user_emulation\n```\n\n#### Capacity planning\n\nThe recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produces large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance. Capacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environments.\n\n - Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill up and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.\n - Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but the rate at which logs are generated.\n - CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules."

While tracking `mount` commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful `open`, `creat` and `truncate` system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates either of these tools, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.\n* Should your organization make use of both `rsyslog` and `journald`, take care how the recommendations may or may not apply to you.\n\n### What is not covered\n* Enterprise logging systems not utilizing `rsyslog` or `journald`.\nAs logging is very situational and dependant on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.\n* Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality.

Authselect offers two ready-made profiles that can be universally used with all modern identity management systems\n\nAuthselect makes testing and troubleshooting easy because it only modifies files in these directories:\n\n- `/etc/nsswitch.conf`\n- `/etc/pam.d/* files`\n- `/etc/dconf/db/distro.d/* files`\n\nYou can create and deploy a custom profile by customizing one of the default profiles, the sssd, winbind, or the nis profile. This is particularly useful if Modifying a ready-made authselect profile is not enough for your needs. When you deploy a custom profile, the profile is applied to every user logging into the given host. This would be the recommended method, so that the existing profiles can remain unmodified.\n\n_Example of creating a custom authselect profile called custom-profile_\n\n```\n# authselect create-profile custom-profile -b sssd --symlink-meta\n```\n\n**WARNING:** \n\nDo not use authselect if: \n- your host is part of Linux Identity Management. Joining your host to an IdM domain with the ipa-client-install command automatically configures SSSD authentication on your host.\n- Your host is part of Active Directory via SSSD. Calling the realm join command to join your host to an Active Directory domain automatically configures SSSD authentication on your host.\n- It is not recommended to change the authselect profiles configured by ipa-client-install or realm join. If you need to modify them, display the current settings before making any modifications, so you can revert back to them if necessary"

                    "prose": "The user file-creation mode mask (`umask`) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (`rwxrwxrwx`), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (`rw-rw-rw-`). The `umask` modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The `umask` is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the `umask` are cleared in the resulting file mode.\n\n`umask` can be set with either `octal` or `Symbolic` values:\n- `Octal` (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie `umask 0027` or `umask 027`. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.\n- `Symbolic` Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User `u`, group `g`, and world/other `o`. The permissions listed are not masked by `umask`. ie a `umask` set by `umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=` is the `Symbolic` equivalent of the `Octal` `umask 027`. This `umask` would set a newly created directory with file mode `drwxr-x---` and a newly created file with file mode `rw-r-----`.\n\nThe default `umask` can be set to use the `pam_umask` module or in a `System Wide Shell Configuration File`. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default `umask` by adding the `umask` command into a `User Shell Configuration File`, ( `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`), in their home directory.\n\nSetting the default umask:\n- pam_umask module:\n - will set the umask according to the system default in `/etc/login.defs` and user settings, solving the problem of different `umask` settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc.\n - `umask=<mask>` value in the `/etc/login.defs` file is interpreted as Octal\n - Setting `USERGROUPS_ENAB` to yes in `/etc/login.defs` (default):\n - will enable setting of the `umask` group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the `uid` is the same as `gid`, and `username` is the same as the `<primary group name>`\n - userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user\n- `System Wide Shell Configuration File`:\n - `/etc/profile` - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the `.bash_profile`, however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. **is only executed for interactive *login* shells, or shells executed with the --login parameter.** \n - `/etc/profile.d` - `/etc/profile` will execute the scripts within `/etc/profile.d/*.sh`. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within `/etc/profile.d` to set your own system wide environmental variables.\n - `/etc/bashrc` - System wide version of `.bashrc`. In Fedora derived distributions, `etc/bashrc` also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if *non-login* shell, but redirects output to `/dev/null` if *non-interactive.* **Is only executed for *interactive* shells or if `BASH_ENV` is set to `/etc/bashrc`.**\n\nUser Shell Configuration Files:\n- `~/.bash_profile` - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. **Is only read by login shells.**\n- `~/.bashrc` - Is executed for interactive shells. **only read by a shell that's both interactive and non-login**"
